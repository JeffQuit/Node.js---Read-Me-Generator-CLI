## Description
The Good README.md generator project is the node.js week project due for the UCLA/Trilogy Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp that tasks the student with building a CLI (command line interface) application in Node.js that will generate a properly formatted README.md file. The application will ask the user a series of questions that will then take that data input and format it into the correct areas for the README.md file. This includes the project title, description, installation guide, usage instructions, collaboration credits, license information, test information, and a questions section which includes links to the user's github profile as well as their email for any additional questions. The application is built in Node.JS and can be executed by running the node index.js command while in the correct repository folder on the local machine. This project was built to streamline the README.md file creation process to ensure that all future README.md files are made with the best possible formatting per the Good README guide and to make this process more efficient for future projects. Throughout this project, I increased my knowledge of building CLI applications as well as how to guide a user through a program to ensure that everything is properly filled out for a README file. In addition, this project required extra research into licenses and which licenses to implement on the README to ensure proper legal coverage of the application developed. What makes this particular project stand out is the in-depth outlining of the license agreements for each of the four possible licenses to choose from. The full agreement is pulled from each of the license provider's websites and a badge is also included which links to the license website for additional information.

## Installation
To install this project, first, branch the github repo to your local device. Once the repo is on your local, you will then need to install the node module dependencies from the JSON package file. This can be done by running the command "npm install" in the repo folder from the terminal or shell command line. Once the dependencies have been installed, you are now ready to use the program. Please see the Usage section of this README.md for usage instructions. 

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, in the terminal or shell, run the command "node index.js". This will run the application and the user will be prompted with the questions to be answered that fill in the areas of the README.md file. Fill in all the questions as they are prompted and at the end, select one of the four licenses for your project. Once completed, there will be a success message in the console that the file was created. You can then either view the file in your code editor or push this project to your repo and view the formatting from the repo. If you do not like how the file was exported, you can either re-run the application or open the README.md file in your code editor and manually make changes to the formatting or content. 

## Credits
This application was completed by Jeff Quittman as a project for UCLA/Trilogy's Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp. Dependencies for this project include the node modules: Inquirer - for creating question prompts in the CLI, Moment - for tracking the year, util - for creating the promisify'ed writeFilyAsync methods.
